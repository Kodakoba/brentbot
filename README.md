# brentbot
it's brentbot, the awesome link utility bot.

.env setup:
needs:
 - TOKEN = <token>
 - BUILD_TYPE = <TEST, RELEASE>
 - BOT_VERSION = 0.1.0
 - CH_BL_FILE_PATH = <text file>
 - CH_WL_FILE_PATH = <text file>

BL contains channel IDs that want to FULLY blacklist links
WL contains channel IDs and a comma regex sting that want to explicitly remove a link type using regex.

# will you continue doing more
maybe idk
